		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
		<p>From Wester Philadelphia I hail,
		where in my youth I'd play upon the green
		'til - rue the day! - I found myself assail'd
		by ruffians contemptable and mean.
		Although the spat was trivial and brief,
		it wounded my dear mother deep within;
		and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
		she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
		Whn to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
		I came upon a coachman most unique;
		and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
		despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
		- I survey all the land with princely mien
		in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
